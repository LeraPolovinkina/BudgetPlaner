### 1. Avalonia UI
[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) is an open source UI framework for building stunning, desktop, mobile, web and embedded applications using a .NET single codebase.

Avalonia UI enables .NET developers to create pixel-perfect apps for desktop, mobile and web from a single codebase. Avalonia UI supports several .NET runtimes, including .NET Framework, Mono and .NET Core.

It's essential to understand that Avalonia works very differently from frameworks like MAUI (or Xamarin.Forms), which uses a platform's native UI toolkit, providing a common API across all the supported platforms.

Avalonia UI is a cross-platform framework that uses its own rendering engine to draw controls. It's not a wrapper around native controls, and it doesn't use native controls. Instead, it uses a cross-platform rendering engine that draws controls using SkiaSharp.

#### Semi.Avalonia
Avalonia theme inspired by Semi Design. 

#### XAML Previewr for Avalonia
The Avalonia XAML Previewer in Visual Studio Code is a powerful tool that allows you to visualise XAML code in real-time. It enables you to efficiently design and fine-tune user interfaces, helping to identify potential issues and visualise the impact of changes instantly.

Since build 2022.3 EAP 7, Rider supports Avalonia previewer using an open-source plugin AvaloniaRider.

#### C# DevKit in VS Code
The C# DevKit is out and gives you a complete .NET experience inside VS Code!

C# Dev Kit helps you manage your code with a solution explorer and test your code with integrated unit test discovery and execution, elevating your C# development experience wherever you like to develop (Windows, macOS, Linux, and even in a Codespace).

This extension builds on top of the great C# language capabilities provided by the C# extension and enhances your C# environment by adding a set of powerful tools and utilities that integrate natively with VS Code to help C# developers write, debug, and maintain their code faster and with fewer errors.

### 3. GitHub Copilot

Q: "Is Avalinia in beta?"
A: "Avalonia is currently in version 0.10.0, which is considered a stable release. However, it is still under active development and new features are being added. You can check the latest version and release notes on the Avalonia website: https://avaloniaui.net/docs/roadmap/"
Note: The link to the website does not even exist.

#### Working Together with IntelliSense
IntelliSense is known for its code-completion functionality, while also providing a variety of code editing features such as parameter info, quick info and member lists, while Copilot is an advanced AI system that goes much further, for example, generating whole code constructs or even entire programs in response to developer prompts.

Developers continue to claim that the "AI pair programmer" GitHub Copilot tool doesn't work well with IntelliSense, which is built in to Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
